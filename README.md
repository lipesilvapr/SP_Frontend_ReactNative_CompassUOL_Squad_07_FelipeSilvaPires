About how the website works<br>
#01-When clicking on the logo located in the header, it will take you to the beginning of its respective page.<br><br>
#02-Of all the items present in the navbar, only the "Blog" works and it takes you to the main page (index.html).<br><br>
#03-The entire site is static and was made with inspiration from the game God of War.<br><br>
#04-All posts work and have their identity on each page, with the same image they had on the main page and with a unique rune marked in the background of the page, for example in post 1 there is a figure of the "Blade of Chaos" that represents the first game in the franchise.<br><br>
#05-The content of each post is described by "Mimir" (who had his appearance in the 4th game and being a great storyteller), and each of the comments, also static, are from characters of the game. Still about the comments, the "Comment here!" it is merely illustrative and is there only for aesthetics.<br><br>
#06-In the footer, the social media images link to my personal profile of both.<br><br>

Hope you like it!<br>
ps: It's my first project using these technologies, every project I've ever done was usually in java or c#, hence the possibly visible inexperience.
